<br/>

Framework to create web apps.
Designed for high development speed with no sacrifice on flexibility.

Assembles a JavaScript stack with integrations for Node.js servers (Express, Koa, Hapi), Node.js ORMs (TypeORM & more to come), React, React Router, React Native Web, Vue.js, TypeScript, PostCSS, etc.

All stacks supported:
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; frontend + backend + database/ORM (aka full-stack)
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; frontend + backend (aka SSR)
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; frontend only (aka static site)
<br/> &nbsp; &#8226; &nbsp; backend only

### Introduction

Web frameworks have a bad reputation regarding flexibility.
There is a general belief that there is a trade off between development speed and flexibility
and that a web framework always comes with a lost in flexibility.
We believe it doesn't have to be that way.

##### Rapid Development

You can create a web app by defining so-called "page configs".
Reframe handles everything else:
It automatically transpiles, bundles, routes, renders, and serves your pages.

In the example above we created a
web application by simply defining a single React component and a single page config.
No need for configuration.

Yet, Reframe is designed from the ground up to be entirely flexible.

##### Flexible

Reframe greatly cares about flexibility.
It is (to our knowledge) the most flexible web framework out there.
We would even argue that Reframe is more flexible than gluying do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries yourself.

Reframe's flexibility is based on three pillars:

1. **Progressive Eject** -
   All Reframe parts are ejectable:
   You can eject the build configuration (the webpack config), and/or the render code, and/or the routing code, and/or the server code, etc.

2. **Minimal glue code** -
   We isolate a maximum of code in do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.
   That way, we manage to keep the glue code to a tiny ~500 lines of code.

3. **Flexible stack** -
   Reframe assembles a flexible stack:
   You can configure your app to have a frontend only (aka static site), a frontend + backend (aka SSR app), a backend only (aka old-school app with plain old HTML), or a frontend + backend + database/ORM (aka full-stack app).
   Also, it is easy to later remove/add a backend, frontend, or database/ORM to an existing app.

Some benefits of Reframe's flexibility:

**Take Over Control** -
You can eject and take control over Reframe parts
as your app grows and the need arises.
All Reframe parts are ejectable which means that you can gain full control.

**Removable** -
If you eject all Reframe parts then you effectively get rid of Reframe.
At that point your code doesn't depend on Reframe anymore and only depends on do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries
(e.g. React, Webpack, etc.).

**Rapid Prototyping** -
You can change your app's stack at any point in time which comes in handy for quick prototyping.
For example,
you can have your first prototype to be a frontend only (static site)
that you can easily deploy (to a static host such as Netlify or GitHub Pages).
You would skip a database by hard-writing the data in your code base.
Then, at a later point when hard-writing data isn't sustainable anymore, you would add a server and a real database to your prototype.

**Learn Once, Write Any App** -
Instead of learning different web frameworks depending on what JavaScript stack you need,
you can learn Reframe to implement apps with any JavaScript stack.

### Examples

- [Frontend](#frontend)
- [Full-stack](#full-stack)

###### Frontend

We define a page config `HelloPage`:

~~~jsx
// ~/my-app/pages/HelloPage.config.js

// By default you write your views with React.
// You can use another view library such as Vue.
import React from 'react';

const HelloPage = {
  route: '/hello/:name', // Parameterized route
  title: 'Hi there', // Page's <title>
  view: props => {
    // The route argument `name` is available at `props.route.args`
    const name = props.route.args.name;
    return (
      <div>Hello {name}</div>
    );
  }
};

export default HelloPage;
~~~

<p align="center">
    <img src='https://github.com/reframejs/reframe/raw/master/docs/images/previews/hello.png?sanitize=true' width="780" style="max-width:100%;"/>
</p>

And that's it,
we created a frontend simply by defining one page config.

###### Full-stack

Let's look at a Todo App.
(Note that the database/ORM integration shown here is work-in-progress.)

~~~ts
import {Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToOne} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Todo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    text: string;

    @Column()
    isCompleted: boolean;

    @ManyToOne("User")
    author: "User";
}
~~~

To make our `Todo` entries accessible from our views, we define permissions:

~~~js
// Only the author of a todo item should be allowed to read & write
const isTodoAuthor = ({loggedUser, object: todo}) => loggedUser && loggedUser.id===todo.author.id;

const permissions = [
    {
        modelName: 'Todo',
        write: isTodoAuthor,
        read: isTodoAuthor,
    },
];
~~~

We can now access `Todo` entries from our view:

~~~js
import React from 'react';
import easyqlClient from '@easyql/client';

const TodoList = ({todos}) => (
    <div>{ todos.map(todo =>
        <div key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</div>
    )}</div>
);

const getInitialProps = async ({req}) => {
    const loggedUser = easyqlClient.getLoggedUser({req});
    const query = {
        queryType: 'read',
        modelName: 'Todo',
        filter: {
            author: {
                id: loggedUser.id,
            },
        },
    };
    const response = await easyqlClient.query({query, req});
    const todos = response.objects;
    return {todos};
};

export default {
    route: '/',
    view: TodoList,
    getInitialProps,
};
~~~

And that's it,
we simply defined pages, data models, and permissions to create a full-stack app.

### Getting Started

Choose a starter:

- [React Server](/docs/react-server-starter.md)
- [React Frontend](/docs/react-frontend-starter.md)
- [React Database](/docs/react-database-starter.md) (Work-in-progress)

They scaffold the following:

&nbsp; | React Frontend | React Server | React Database
--- | :---: | :---: | :---:
React Frontend | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Node.js Server | :x: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:
Database/ORM | :x: | :x: | :heavy_check_mark:

Don't bother choosing the right starter:
You can easily add/remove a Node.js server and add/remove a database/ORM afterwards.
Instead, quickly choose a starter and start write your prototype.
As your prototype grows add/remove what you need.

### Introduction

Reframe is a framework to create web apps.
It is designed to allow high development speed without sacrificing flexibility.

A JavaScript stack is assembled for you that can integrate with
Node.js, React, React Native Web, React Router, Vue.js, TypeScript, TypeORM, PostCSS, Webpack, Express, Koa, Hapi, etc.

All JavaScript stacks are supported:
Full-stack (frontend + backend + database with a Node.js ORM),
frontend + backend (aka SSR app),
frontend only (aka static site), and
backend only.

<br/>

**Rapid Development**

You can create a web app by defining so-called "page configs".
Reframe handles everything else:
It automatically transpiles, bundles, routes, renders, and serves your pages.

</p>

That's it.
A web application by simply defining a single React component and a single page config.
No need for configuration.

Yet, Reframe is designed from the ground up to be fully flexible.

<br/>

**Flexible**

Web frameworks have a bad reputation regarding flexibility.
There is a general belief that there is a trade off between development speed and flexibility
and that a web framework always comes with a lost in flexibility.
We believe it doesn't have to be that way.

Reframe greatly cares about flexibility.
It is (to our knowledge) the most flexible web framework out there.
We would even argue that Reframe is more flexible than gluying do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries yourself.

Reframe's flexibility is based on three pillars:

1. **Progressive Eject** -
   All Reframe parts are ejectable:
   You can eject the build configuration (the webpack config), and/or the render code, and/or the routing code, and/or the server code, etc.

2. **Minimal glue code** -
   We isolate a maximum of code in do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries.
   That way, we manage to keep the glue code to a tiny ~500 lines of code.

3. **Flexible stack** -
   Reframe assembles a flexible stack:
   You can configure your app to have a frontend only (aka static site), a frontend + backend (aka SSR app), a backend only (aka old-school app with plain old HTML), or a frontend + backend + database/ORM (aka full-stack app).
   Also, it is easy to later remove/add a backend, frontend, or database/ORM to an existing app.

Some benefits of Reframe's flexibility:

**Take Over Control** -
You can eject and take control over Reframe parts
as your app grows and as the need arises.
All Reframe parts are ejectable which means that you can gain full control.

**Removable** -
If you eject all Reframe parts then you effectively get rid of Reframe.
At that point your code doesn't depend on Reframe anymore and only depends on do-one-thing-do-it-well libraries
(e.g. React, Webpack, etc.).

**Rapid Prototyping** -
You can change your app's stack at any point in time which comes in handy for quick prototyping.
For example,
you can have your first prototype to be a frontend only (static site)
that you can easily deploy (to a static host such as Netlify or GitHub Pages).
You would skip a database by hard-writing the data in your code base.
Then, at a later point when hard-writing data isn't sustainable anymore, you would add a server and a real database to your prototype.

**Learn Once, Write Any App** -
Instead of learning different web frameworks depending on what JavaScript stack you need,
you can learn Reframe to implement apps with any JavaScript stack.

### Examples

- [Frontend](#frontend)
- [Full-stack](#full-stack)

###### Frontend

We define a page config `HelloPage`:

~~~jsx
// ~/my-app/pages/HelloPage.config.js

!INLINE ../examples/basics/pages/HelloPage.config.js --hide-source-path
~~~

<p align="center">
    <img src='https://github.com/reframejs/reframe/raw/master/docs/images/previews/hello.png?sanitize=true' width="780" style="max-width:100%;"/>
</p>

And that's it,
we created a frontend simply by defining one page config.

###### Full-stack

Let's look at a Todo App.
(Note that the database/ORM integration shown here is work-in-progress.)

~~~ts
import {Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToOne} from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Todo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    text: string;

    @Column()
    isCompleted: boolean;

    @ManyToOne("User")
    author: "User";
}
~~~

To make our `Todo` entries accessible from our views, we define permissions:

~~~js
// Only the author of a todo item should be allowed to read & write
const isTodoAuthor = ({loggedUser, object: todo}) => loggedUser && loggedUser.id===todo.author.id;

const permissions = [
    {
        modelName: 'Todo',
        write: isTodoAuthor,
        read: isTodoAuthor,
    },
];
~~~

We can now access `Todo` entries from our view:

~~~js
import React from 'react';
import easyqlClient from '@easyql/client';

const TodoList = ({todos}) => (
    <div>{ todos.map(todo =>
        <div key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</div>
    )}</div>
);

const getInitialProps = async ({req}) => {
    const loggedUser = easyqlClient.getLoggedUser({req});
    const query = {
        queryType: 'read',
        modelName: 'Todo',
        filter: {
            author: {
                id: loggedUser.id,
            },
        },
    };
    const response = await easyqlClient.query({query, req});
    const todos = response.objects;
    return {todos};
};

export default {
    route: '/',
    view: TodoList,
    getInitialProps,
};
~~~

And that's it,
we simply defined pages, data models, and permissions to create a full-stack app.
